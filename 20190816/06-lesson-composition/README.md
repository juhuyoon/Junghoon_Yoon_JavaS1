# Lesson Overview: Composition

## Topics
*	Composition

## Assessments
*	Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE

## Approach
We start by talking about **has-a** relationships in real life (a house **has-a** stove, a car **has-a** engine). We then move into a code example that models an account to an online retailer like Amazon. We start with a poor implementation and then refactor it using composition to make the code more maintainable and reduce repetition. We do an in-class activity that has learners refactor the code further using the techniques covered in the lesson. 

Finally, we have a discussion about the limitations of refactored code given the limited exposure to data structures (arrays only so far!). This will set up the beginning of the next module.

## Assumptions
* We talked about interfaces and loosely coupled contract-type relationship in the previous lesson.
