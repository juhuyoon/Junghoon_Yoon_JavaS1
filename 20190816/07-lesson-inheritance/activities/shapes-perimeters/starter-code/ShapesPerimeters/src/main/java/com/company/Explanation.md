While there are multiple standards and practices to abide by in development, there seems to often be a debate amongst what can be the best implementation. 

This best implemetation contention would keep in consideration not only just efficiency, but also the importance of keeping developers in sync as well as clean code for refactoring later on. 

In a strict coding sense, the major differences between the three implementations of interface, abstract classes, and concrete classes seem to be the different level of data access and the level of control that you can provide in the different implementations, if I were to pick one 'best' implementation, I would lean towards utilizing interfaces more than the other two design patterns. 

When the developer is interested in providing for a clean design for the other team to follow, by providing a strict clear guidelines to the methods, interface seems to be a start way to start and guide any features and project builds from the ground up.

While abstract classes also seem to provide the same level of control, due to the key differences between EXTENDS additional classes and using IMPLEMENTS for an interface, while greater data control comes from abstract classes, interface as a whole seems to be better practice to keep developers in line. 
Despite the obvious useability that abstract classes seem to offer, if clean code and strict coding standards are required, interfaces seem to be a better pick.

As compared to concrete classes, concrete classes should be used in conjunction with the interface as a final class after the base classes have implemented the interface to cascade down through multiple derived classes. 

Thus, I believe that the interface implementation is best and perhaps the most frequently used standard due to the reasons above.
