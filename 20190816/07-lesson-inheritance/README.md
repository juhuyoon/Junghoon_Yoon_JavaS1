# Lesson Overview: Inheritance

## Topics
*	Extending an interface
*	Specialization through inheritance
*	Code reuse
*	Method overriding
*	Access control
*	Constructors
*	Abstract base classes

## Assessments
*	Shapes and Perimeters
*	Code katas

## Required Software and Resources
* Java
* IDE

## Approach
We continue our discussion of relationships among classes and the tools available in Java to help us express them. Inheritance allows us to express hierarchical relationships between classes. We look at several real-world examples of hierarchical relationships and then dive into the syntax and mechanics of inheritance in Java. This lesson is a bit more dense than the previous two because there is a lot of jargon associated with inheritance.

## Assumptions
* We talked about interfaces and composition in the previous two lessons.
