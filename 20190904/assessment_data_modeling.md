1. What was the most difficult part of this model?
  The most difficult part of the model was first figuring the business logic that would be needed to store all the data needed. 

  If all the data is organized, then discovering the relationship between them would be an efficiency discussion. 

2. What change along the way presented the biggest challenge?
  Reformatting during the discussions to determine whether a many-to-many relationship would be needed was the biggest challenge, as it had to involve how to correctly keep track of how many videos would have to be rented out as well as how to keep track of that for each individual rental ID. 

3. How difficult or easy was it to change your model midstream?
  As long as the logic was discussed as to why the change had to occur, changing the model midstream was somewhat easy. However, the discusssion itself was the difficult part of the refactoring. 

4. Were there any columns on which your team didn't agree on a data type?
  There were no columns in which the team did not agree on a data type.
