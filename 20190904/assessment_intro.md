1. Why is it important to have a good understanding of the underlying business when creating a data model?
  The data model will be the breakdown of what the business will be storing and how to keep track of the inventory as well as any other information the business needs to track. To reduce potential refactorings as well as user error, a good architecture and mock should be done to ensure that as much as possible is covered for preparing the data models and breaking them down. 

2. Compare and contrast data and metadata.
  Data would be the storage of the information that the business decides to hold while the metadata are specifically the properties of data that specifies what the data can hold. 


3. What is the difference between an entity and an attribute?
  An entity is the overarching table that will be stored in the database, while the attribute is the specific part of the entity to keep track of as columns. 


4. What is a primary key?
  The primary key is the main unique identifier for each instance that would be stored in the rows of the entity. They can be set to either unique attributes from the entity, just a integer counter, or hashcodes. 

5. What is a foreign key?
  A foreign key is when you refer back to a primary key of another table to access it to the current table. 

6. What is the purpose of relationships in a relational database?
  By having separate entities that divide the datasets, you can use relationals to connect the datasets together in order to create larget datasets that show a more concise data. 
  (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many)  

7. What does a row represent in a relational database?
  The row itself would be an instance of that entity to keep track of as columns.
